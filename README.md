## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  

### 🔍 Dashboard Preview  

#### 1️⃣ Region 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6911d7ef-ec8b-4aee-b20c-0e50211214f1)

📌 Analysis:  

- Total revenue reached $9.48M with a total profit of $1.09M. The average return rate is 4.68%, and the overall ROI is 13%. While the company is operating profitably overall, regional performance varies significantly and highlights clear areas for optimization and expansion.  

- The Central region generated the highest revenue ($2.07M) but only moderate ROI, with a return rate of 4.79%. This suggests potential inefficiencies in cost structure or operations. Regions like South and North show stable performance with decent revenue and ROI — current strategy can be maintained.

- In contrast, Canada and North Asia stand out with very high ROI (38.1% and 24%, respectively). Canada, though small in current revenue, presents a high-growth opportunity and should be prioritized for expansion. North Asia also shows strong profitability, but the return rate is high (13.83%), indicating issues with product quality, expectations, or logistics — which need to be resolved before scaling further.

- Southeast Asia and EMEA deliver low ROI and minimal profit, suggesting a mismatch between product-market fit or operational inefficiencies. Investment in these regions should be limited or re-evaluated unless performance improves.

💡 Recommendation:  

- Expand into high-ROI regions: Prioritize Canada and North Asia (with return rate improvements).

- Optimize cost & return rate in high-revenue regions like Central.

- Maintain steady operations in South, North, and West.

- Limit further investment in Southeast Asia and EMEA until performance metrics improve.

#### 2️⃣ Product  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d37d8705-1d96-4195-87b4-15bb3ab8e501)  

📌 Analysis:   

- Total revenue reached $9.48M with a total profit of $1.09M and an average profit margin of 11.5%. The overall product return rate is 4.68%.  

- Top revenue products include Phones ($1.38M), Copiers ($1.25M), and Chairs/Bookcases ($1.2M).

- Highest profit contributors are Copiers ($0.22M), Phones ($0.18M), and Bookcases ($0.13M) — showing both strong sales and good margins.

- In terms of ROI, Technology (16.98%) and Office Supplies (15.41%) outperform Furniture (7.12%).

- Products with high return rates include Tables (7.28%), Appliances (5.92%), and Accessories (5.72%).

- Products with low return rates include Art (3.15%), Binders (3.61%), and Labels (3.75%).  

⭐ Based on revenue, profit, ROI, and return rate, the following are recommended as strategic products:

- Copiers: High revenue and profit, strong ROI, moderate return rate. Falls under the high-performing Technology category.

- Phones: Highest revenue, decent profit, acceptable return rate. Great potential for market expansion.

- Bookcases / Chairs: Consistent performance, but ROI can be improved through cost control (Furniture category).

- Binders / Labels: Low-volume but low-return-rate products with stable margins — suitable for B2B or bulk-sale strategies.

💡 Recommendation:  

- Focus on Technology and Office Supplies categories due to high ROI and strong profitability. Prioritize products like Copiers and Phones for strategic growth.

- Reduce return rates for high-potential items like Tables and Appliances by improving product quality, descriptions, and customer experience.

- Review underperforming products with low profit and high return rates for possible repositioning or phase-out.

- Consider scaling stable niche products like Binders and Labels through bundled offers or business-targeted campaigns.
